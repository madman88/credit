Design designs

1. Chose ruby as I am familiar with it.
2. The credit card class a pretty straightforward.
3. The validation for the card number could have been done in many ways
   -> There is already a gem.
   -> I chose to implement a function which would do this as it is pretty straightforward.
4. The main script `client` is the one which reads the args and switches based
   on the operation to be done.
5. I thought of using OptParse but that seemed like a bit of an overkill as
   there are only 2 options. But if I were to evolve this I would definitely
   use `Thor` or Optparse
6. Credit client is a simple wrapper which I tested by checking whether the Creditcard
   object received the relevant messages.

Usage: bin/client bin/input.txt or  bin/client < bin/input.txt
